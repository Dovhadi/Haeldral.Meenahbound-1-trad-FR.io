      @cronus_huh CRONUS: you knowv, youre being a bit hypocritical here, dont you think?
      @meenah_idle MEENAH: what

      @cronus_smug CRONUS: like you arent evwen more guilty of abusing the poor fella.
      @meenah_fishtalk MEENAH: youre such a glubbin liar
      @cronus_smug CRONUS: oh am i?
      @cronus_happytalk:#helmsman CRONUS: tell me, pray tell, vwho vwas it exactly, in vwhich alternate univwerse, that used growvnup captor as a livwing vwarp drivwe in her spaceship for millenia?
      @meenah_fish MEENAH: hey that wasnt me
      @meenah_idle MEENAH: i mean

      @meenah_wut2:#38( MEENAH: and... yeah
      @cronus_bored:#i.e.-literally-evweryone CRONUS: oh, howv the rationalizations begin to flowv vwhen it suits your ovwerinflated ego. so vwery typical of the kind of people vwho reject me.
      @meenah_annoyedtalk MEENAH: at least i dont think im an alien
      @cronus_huh CRONUS: vwhat? vwhat are you talking about?
      @meenah_annoyedtalk MEENAH: look at you all frontin in that stupid getup
      @meenah_annoyedtalk MEENAH: with your slicked hair and that dumb little wand in your mouth
      @cronus_bored CRONUS: excuse me. its not a vwand. you knovw perfectly vwell my vwizarding days are behind me. its called a "human cigarette" and apparently youre supposed to set it on fire.
      @cronus_talk CRONUS: although if you ask me, burning it seems like a vwaste of a perfectly good and cool "cigarette."
      @meenah_annoyedtalk MEENAH: i heard a rumor you think youre a human now
      @meenah_wut MEENAH: that true
      @cronus_upset2 CRONUS: its a privwate matter. i dont see vwhy i should havwe to talk about it vwith you, and open myself up to more of your judgmental scorn.
      @meenah_happytalk MEENAH: sounds like another desperate cry for attention imo
      @kankri_talk KANKRI: I feel I sh9uld jump in here at this m9ment, Meenah, 6ef9re y9u inadvertently shame Cr9nus f9r his extremely delicate feelings 9f species dysph9ria.
      @cronus_surprised CRONUS: no, kankri... man, you dont need to jump in here and defend me like this. i got it.
      @meenah_annoyed MEENAH: aaaand im gone
      @meenah_annoyedtalk MEENAH: you bros can figure out your boring feelings without me
      @cronus_sad2 CRONUS: meenah vwait... awv man. just like that, shes out of my life again. you had to go and fuck it up for me, didnt you? some "friends" i havwe.
      @kankri_talk KANKRI: Listen, I was d9ing y9u a fav9r. Y9u d9n't need t9 6e dating any9ne wh9 can't appreciate y9u f9r wh9 y9u really are, 9r m9re imp9rtantly, which fantasy versi9n 9f y9urself y9u m9st str9ngly identify with.
      @cronus_bored:#evwen-the-ones-vwho-literally-identify-as-cats CRONUS: yeah, youre probably right. she doesnt appreciate me. so fevw of you cats do, really. 
      @cronus_upset2 CRONUS: to be honest, she might be right. sometimes i think i might only be saying im a human to get attention. maybe i should givwe it up.
      @kankri_talk4:#TW#invalidated-struggles#triggered-emotions KANKRI: I'd be extremely disappointed to hear that, if it were true. That would be such a slap in the face to all those who know themselves to be an alien while trapped in the pedestrian body of their own race. It would be unspeakably invalidating of their struggles and massively triggering to their emotions. 
      @kankri_talk2 KANKRI: 6ut f9rtunately, I kn9w y9u w9uld never st99p as l9w as that. Y9u understanda6ly have d9u6ts a69ut y9ur feelings and pr96a6ly d9wnplay them as a defense mechanism, since s9 few are prepared t9 rec9gnize the legitimacy 9f y9ur plight. 6ut I am, and I just wanted y9u t9 kn9w that I'm here f9r y9u, and am prepared t9 lecture t9 y9u extensively, I mean, listen t9 y9u extensively, a69ut y9ur ultra-imp9rtant pr96lem.
      @cronus_happy CRONUS: vwowv. thanks, pal.
      @cronus_happytalk CRONUS: youre right. my feelings really are real. not fake, like the huge disappointing fraud that magic turned out to be. 
      @cronus_talk CRONUS: i guess the truth is, deep dowvn i alvways knewv i vwas a 1950s-style human greaser.
      @cronus_talk CRONUS: i just needed to finally be introduced to human culture to make sense of those feelings.
      @kankri_pray KANKRI: W9nderful. I'm s9 happy y9u have f9und the light 9f truth within y9urself. N9w j9in me in tagging 9ur discussi9n with righte9us warnings, as we c9nsecrate y9ur disadvantage in the h9ly annals 9f Pr96lematics.
